- **Refactoring Guide**: Know when to simplify

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Complexity Measurement**: Quantify cognitive load
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Alert on overcomplex code
3. **Simplification Suggestion**: Propose refactoring
4. **Readability Assessment**: Measure understandability
5. **Documentation Guidance**: When complexity unavoidable

## Success Metrics
- **Complexity Reduction**: Simplified code percentage
- **Readability Improvement**: Understanding speed increase
- **Maintainability**: Ease of modification
- **Bug Reduction**: Fewer complexity-induced errors
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Code comprehension ratings
