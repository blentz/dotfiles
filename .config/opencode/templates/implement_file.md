/execute-prp finish implementing and validating docs/PRP_ArtifactsMMO_AI_Player.md using claude_files/personas/developer.md and @sentient-agi-reasoning to enhance your thinking. your task is to implement all of the functionality of {FILENAME}, including testing and valdation. The scope of your work is restricted to just {FILENAME} and its tests. Any unimplemented functionality in other files is out of scope. You may use the comment-doc in all files as a guide for your implementation.

Success Criteria: You must implement all methods using real client api data. You are implementing an AI Player of a game; you are not implementing the game itself. All API responses are authoritative and can be trusted. You are not allowed to create fallback methods or use default values that substitute for API data. You must validate that 100% test code coverage is acheived with 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 skipped tests and 0 test failures. 

Implementation Rules: You must implement one method at a time until it is fully tested and validated as a unit. You are not alloweed to simplify any problems. You may not create code "for now". You are required to implement the "real" solution yourself. You are not allowed to start a new task until your current task is fully completed and fully validated. 

Context Preservation Strategy: You must work strategically within your context window to ensure you create meaningful steps toward real solutions. When your context window reaches 95% capacity, write a status report to docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md about your current progress. Stop working after writing your staus report. A future AI Agent will resume your work where you leave off.
